# EvenOrNotEven
Write a program that generates a random number between 1 and 100 (you can use the Random () method from the Math class).
In the next step checks (thanks to modulo) whether it is an even or an odd number. 
Each of the above actions should be written to the consoles, adding a text explaining what has been done.
